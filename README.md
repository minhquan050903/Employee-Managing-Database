# Employee-Managing-Database

I was part of a group project where we collaborated to write SQL queries to extract required information from a database. My responsibilities included contributing to the design and development of the SQL queries, testing and debugging them to ensure accuracy and efficiency, and working closely with my team members to ensure timely delivery of the project.

During this project, I gained hands-on experience in writing complex SQL queries and utilizing various database management tools. I also developed strong problem-solving skills as we encountered challenges and worked together to find solutions.

Overall, this project allowed me to strengthen my technical skills as a software engineer and taught me the importance of teamwork and collaboration in delivering high-quality projects.

Note: Database was provided by the Creation Script and all SQL querries can be found in querries.sql file
